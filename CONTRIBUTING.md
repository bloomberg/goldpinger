# Contributing to `Goldpinger`

If you'd like to help us improve and extend this project, then we welcome your contributions!

Below you will find some basic steps required to be able to contribute to the project. If you have any questions about this process or any other aspect of contributing to a Bloomberg open source project, feel free to send an email to opensource@bloomberg.net and we'll get your questions answered as quickly as we can.

Pull Requests are always welcome, however they will only be accepted if they provide a reasonably test coverage.

## Contribution Licensing

Since `Goldpinger` is distributed under the terms of the [Apache Version 2 license](LICENSE), contributions that you make are licensed under the same terms. In order for us to be able to accept your contributions, we will need explicit confirmation from you that you are able and willing to provide them under these terms, and the mechanism we use to do this is called a Developer's Certificate of Origin [DCO](DCO.md).  This is very similar to the process used by the Linux(R) kernel, Samba, and many other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the last line of the commit message for each commit in your contribution:

    Signed-Off-By: Random J. Developer <random@developer.example.org>

The simplest way to accomplish this is to add `-s` or `--signoff` to your `git commit` command.

You must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous contributions).

## Help / Documentation

The [README](README.md) is the best place to start.
